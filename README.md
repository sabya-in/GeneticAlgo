Genetic Algorithm implementations for ML applications

While searching for optimized GAs most of them took a lot of time to converge and also gave a lower accuracy score.
This is an attempt to go along the basic principles of GA to:

1. Minimize the convergenge time , which is the basic goal of using GA in first place
2. Get an reasonably high optimization
3. Define strategy and theory for implementations that can optimize different ML models
