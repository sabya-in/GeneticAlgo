# Selecting the proper parameters that best optimizes Linear regression (data: Sci Kit Breast cancer data)

1. Best convergence speed at size = no of features (= 30)
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   100 is worst case scenario and took a huge time to converge with lower accuracy, 
   it feels useless to increase size beyond n_feat, so that in an uniform randomly 
   distributed set at lease each feature have an fair 50p.c change of selection
   in a binary chromosome. Each feature hence will have an fair change of selection
   beyond 30 fair chance of selection may not be affected much and for less than 30 fair
   chance of selection for all feature is less. 
 
2. Selection of just two parents and weeding out two least fit individual with two mutated children 
   (Steady State over Generational , https://www.tutorialspoint.com/genetic_algorithms/genetic_algorithms_population.htm)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Selection of just parents reduces search space but at same time consolidates a seed
    or child for faster search and convergence. Also to reasonably broaden the search 
    field we only generate two offprings and also mutate them with a 10 percent rate 
    in mutation. This ofcourse works very well and also does not reduce the search space
    considerably since only the two weakest individuals in a generation are removed other
    weaker individuals remain. This is specially effective in this case since the target
    optimization is not much higher than unoptimized effeciency / accuracy. 
    (from 90p.c to about 99p.c when optimized) This achives , reasoanable search 
    space but still deterministic progress towards the intended accuracy.
